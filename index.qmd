## 👋 Hi I'm Abdul.
I specialize in conducting market research and survey. I’ve successfully led various market research and survey projects. These projects honed my skills in quantitative and qualitative research methods, statistical reasoning, and project management. If you're looking for guidance on presenting your results or building complex interactive charts, I'm the expert you're seeking.

With a solid 12-year track record in social research, I thrive on turning complex numerical data into meaningful patterns and predictions. My experience includes working with large datasets in market research projects, where I utilized Excel, SQL, R,and Tableau to uncover insights that informed strategic decisions.

As I transition into AI and data science, I am eager to apply my research background data analytics to a corporate setting. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to analyze consumer data to optimize product development and marketing strategies. I am ready to leverage my analytic expertise to make a tangible impact on your business growth.
