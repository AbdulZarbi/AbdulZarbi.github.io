These projects honed my skills in quantitative and qualitative research methods, statistical reasoning, and project management.\nWith a Master’s degree in Public Administration and a Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Certification, I have a strong understanding of the theoretical foundation of data analysis, which I apply to real-world business problems.\nI thrive on turning complex numerical data into meaningful patterns and predictions. My experience includes working with large datasets in research projects, where I utilized R, SPSS, and Tableau to uncover insights that informed strategic decisions. My attention to detail and accuracy has been commended by my supervisors and colleagues alike.\nAs I transition into the world of data, I am eager to apply my research background to a corporate setting. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to analyze consumer data to optimize product development and marketing strategies. I am ready to leverage my analytical expertise to make a tangible impact on business growth.\nI’m actively seeking opportunities, and my passion for AI and data science drives my desire to make a meaningful contribution.\nI look forward to connecting with new professionals.
